* Use at least 1 directives
* Use angular routing (at least 1 route)
* Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).

* Commit frequently to the git repository.
* Include a README file that contains a description of your application.
* Level of effort displayed in creativity and user experience.
